@DRUG$: Concomitant cholestyramine administration decreased the mean AUC of total @DRUG$ approximately 55%. 1newlineCholestyramine: Concomitant @DRUG$ administration decreased the mean AUC of total @DRUG$ approximately 55%. 0newlineThe incremental LDL-C reduction due to adding @DRUG$ to @DRUG$ may be reduced by this interaction. 0newlinePatients who take both @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ should be carefully monitored. 1newlineCarcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility A 104-week dietary carcinogenicity study with @DRUG$ was conducted in rats at doses up to 1500 mg/kg/day (males) and 500 mg/kg/day (females) (~20 times the human exposure at 10 mg daily based on AUC0-24hr for total @DRUG$). 1newlineA 104-week dietary carcinogenicity study with @DRUG$ was also conducted in mice at doses up to 500 mg/kg/day (>150 times the human exposure at 10 mg daily based on AUC0-24hr for total @DRUG$). 1newlineIn oral (gavage) fertility studies of @DRUG$ conducted in rats, there was no evidence of reproductive toxicity at doses up to 1000 mg/kg/day in male or female rats (~7 times the human exposure at 10 mg daily based on AUC0-24hr for total @DRUG$). 1newline@DRUG$: The safety and effectiveness of @DRUG$ administered with fibrates have not been established. 1newline@DRUG$: The safety and effectiveness of ezetimibe administered with @DRUG$ have not been established. 1newlineFibrates: The safety and effectiveness of @DRUG$ administered with @DRUG$ have not been established. 1newlineIn rabbits treated with @DRUG$, an increased incidence of extra thoracic ribs was observed at 1000 mg/kg/day (150 times the human exposure at 10 mg daily based on AUC0-24hr for total @DRUG$). 1newlineMultiple dose studies of @DRUG$ given in combination with @DRUG$ (statins) in rats and rabbits during organogenesis result in higher ezetimibe and statin exposures. 1newlineMultiple dose studies of @DRUG$ given in combination with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (@DRUG$) in rats and rabbits during organogenesis result in higher ezetimibe and statin exposures. 1newlineMultiple dose studies of @DRUG$ given in combination with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) in rats and rabbits during organogenesis result in higher @DRUG$ and statin exposures. 1newline
