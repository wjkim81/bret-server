In our setting, @DISEASE$ among alcoholic individuals seems to be independent of the presence of mutations C282Y, H63D and S65C in the @GENE$ gene. 1newlineMPO genotype GG is associated with @DISEASE$ in patients with hereditary @GENE$. 0newlineThese three studies do not provide consistent evidence supporting the hypothesis that @GENE$ mutations are associated with an increased risk of @DISEASE$ and with the development of arteriosclerosis. 0newlineOur prospective findings suggest that individuals carrying the @GENE$ C282Y mutation may be at increased risk of @DISEASE$. 1newlineWe conclude that  homozygosity for the G1514-->A mutation is exclusively responsible for the adult form of @DISEASE$ in this family, and that the A619-->G substitution is not a deleterious mutation but rather a common @GENE$ polymorphism. 1newlineThe data suggest that the @GENE$ gene or a linked locus significantly modulates the risk for @DISEASE$. 1newlineThe novel gene @GENE$ may be related with the infiltration and proliferation of @DISEASE$. 1newlineOur findings suggest that the genetic variants of the @GENE$ but not the TIM-3 gene contribute to @DISEASE$ susceptibility in this African-American population. 1newlineIn conclusion, the M416V polymorphism of @GENE$ gene is not associated with insulin resistance in @DISEASE$. 1newlineWe found no evidence that mutation in @GENE$,GNGT1,or RGS9 gene is a cause of @DISEASE$. 1newlineThese results suggest that the @GENE$ null genotype may be associated with increased risk of @DISEASE$. 1newlineThese findings suggest that the GSTA1 and @GENE$ polymorphisms are associated with @DISEASE$ susceptibility, especially among smokers. 1newlineThese findings suggest that individual susceptibility to @DISEASE$ may be modulated by GSTM1, @GENE$ and NAT2 polymorphisms. 1newline
